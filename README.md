# Ultrasonic-Range-Finder

The Ultrasonic Range Finger is used for measuring the distance between it and any object safely and
quickly. This unit consists of LCD display, HC-SR04 Sensor, Push-button, and Processing circuit. The
Sensor transmits an 8 cycle burst of ultrasound at 40 kHz and waits for the sound wave to reflect back
to itâ€™s receiver. Distance is measured as soon as the device is powered and will be displayed on the LCD.
